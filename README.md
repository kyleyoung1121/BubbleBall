# Bubble Ball

## Overview

Welcome to Bubble Ball, a hobby project by Kyle Young!
This game is my interpretation of the arcade game, Death Ball.
The purpose of the project is to try to recreate the fun I've had with friends playing Death Ball at my local arcade.
All code is my own, but many mechanics are directly from the original Death Ball arcade game

## Features

- **Multiplayer Action**: Connect several controllers (and a keyboard if you wish) to play with up to 8 players
- **Unique Maps**: Explore various maps with different layouts and unique wrap-around paths.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust your volume mix & game modifiers from the pause menu!
